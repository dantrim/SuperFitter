	* Fixed error in the setting of regions for where to fit.
	* Modified the runBatch script
	
2013-08-19 Matt
	* Added fakes as separate tree.  

2013-08-16 Matt
	* Modified batch script to handle latest running options
	* Updated README
	* Tagging -00-00-05
	* Fixed bug when trying to run ModeC, would crash because claimed no grid, but just issue with if vs. elif
	* Updated runBatchLimit.sh to easily toggle the options between grids.  Now default is sparse grid
	* Added sparse slepton grid

2013-08-02 Matt
	* Modified batch script
	* Added more command line options
	* Added possibility of running slepton limits for RH+LH, RH, and LH
	* Tagging 00-00-04

2013-08-02 Matt
	* Adding batch scripts to run
	* Added more grid options to take into account splitting up the points for batch submission -- faster for running
	* Modified fitting for mT2 regions to only fit for mT2 > 90 for ZV regardless of mT2 value
	* Unblinding signal region as default

	* M      dumpTables.sh: Switch to MINOS errors, add corrMatrix to outputs
	* M      SelectionConfig.py: Organize a bit, use ee+mm for ZVCR-mT2
	* M      SetSimultaneousFitOptions.py: Added emZVCR-mT2 definitions, genertic
	* M      LimitConfig.py: Tweaked the sim. fit part a bit. We need normalization regions only if we fit
				 otherwise don't define. Fit ZV only in ee+mm and not separately. Should also switch
				 to fitting only in CRZV-mT2,90 for all mT2 based SRs.
				 Add theory uncertainties only in the SR. Otherwise, you profile (I don't think this is correct)
				 but more importantly you introduce possible anti-correlation between the scale factor and 
				 theory uncertainties, shrinking the error.

	* Added systematic command line option
	* Modified dumpTable.sh to work with new option
	* Fixed error when running signal samples with systematics.  Wasn't setting file properly.

	* Added three options for running limits, script will not execute unless SR Channel Grid are specified
	* Added a runLimit.sh script as an example of how to use
	* Updated README
	* Tagging LimitScripts-00-00-02

# of the implementation from Geraldine and Pascal, and have     #

This package needs to be placed inside of your HistFitter 
directory.  If you have checked it out somewhere else,
please move it into HistFitter directory.  Otherwise it
will not know where to look for the packages.

Once that has been done, you can execute from the
HistFitter directory by doing:

HistFitter.py -trwf LimitScripts/LimitConfig.py <SR> <Channel> <Grid> <Sys> <SlepOpt>

<SR>      -- This is the signal region to run over. Right now
              options are SR1 SR2a SR2b SR4a SR4b SR4c
<Channel> -- The channel: all ee mm em
<Grid>    -- SMCwslep and DLiSlep are supported. You may need to add yours once you 
	     have name. It should be same name as what it is for your HFTs.
<Sys>     -- These are to include the theory uncertainty on signal.  Options are NoSys, up, down
<SlepOpt> -- This is if we need to run LH/RH only limits for sleptons. It can be left blank
	     if the user is not running slepton limits. It will be attached to the output
  	     file names only in the case of slepton limits.  If no option is given for the
  	     slepton case, then RH+LH is assumed

This will produce the histograms and the workspace.
The histograms will be put into the data/ directory
and the workspace will be saved in results/ directory.

To change the configuration, look in LimitConfig.py
in order to see the configurable options.  Everything
is specified at the top of the file.  Some general
strings are specified, and then one RuntimeOptions(...)
object is created where all the running options are set.

//---------------------------//
// LimitConifg  
//---------------------------//

This is what is actually run.  The user specifies the
options for this particular run at the top of the file
and then executes using:

HistFitter.py <options> LimitScripts/LimitConfig.py

Other modules are used by this configuration script.

Please note that the user will have to change:
* indir to be the location of their input HFTs
* bkgFile to the name of their background trees
* signalFile to the name of their signal trees
* Samples (ex zxSample) to have the right name used
  in their trees. Serhan and Geraldine use different
  conventions for some of these (eg. higgs vs. Higgs).

//---------------------------//
// RuntimeOptions
//---------------------------//

This is a class to house all the options.  The list in 
there currently is probably not exhaustive, so more
can be added to make the code more flexible in 
future iterations.

//---------------------------//
// ConfigDefs
//---------------------------//

This is where some generic 'enum' type objects are
stored (eg. lepton channel) and also where the
grids will be kept.  This trims down on space
in the main configuration file.  The user can
also add more information to this as neccessary

//---------------------------//
// SystematicObject
//---------------------------//

This is another class where all of the sytematics are 
turned on and set.  Then in LimitConfig, the sys
can be accessed via the sys object. In the case of 
generator uncertainty, these are done by hand in the
LimitConfig.py script.  If you need to add a new 
signal region, you will have to look in TheoryUncertainties.py
to see if your SR is supported.  If not, add it with the corresponding
uncertianty.

//---------------------------//
// SelectionConfig
//---------------------------//

This is where all of the different selections are set.
Basicaly the cuts dictionary is manipulated in here,
so if new selections are needed/added, they can be
incorporated here.

//---------------------------//
// SetSimultaneousFitOptions
//---------------------------//

This is a simple method to set the fit options to be
used.  It will specifically tell HistFitter what 
control regions to fit for various backgrounds and
lepton channels.

//---------------------------//
// TheoryUncertainties
//---------------------------//

This contains the current theory uncertainties. The
appropriate uncertainties are assigned based on the signal 
region.  They are set by hand in LimitConfig.
